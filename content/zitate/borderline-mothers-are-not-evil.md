The British philosopher, Edmund Burke (letter to William Smith, 1795), claimed that “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” Borderline mothers are not evil; evil lies in the darkness of unawareness. They cannot see what they are doing. Those of us who can see must shine the light of our understanding like a beacon guiding a ship to harbor, or share in the responsibility of allowing mothers to drown their own children in a sea of despair.
